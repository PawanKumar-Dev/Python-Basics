# variable names are case sensitive in python
# there are primarly 5 diffrent data types:
# string data type(Can use both single and double quotes. Even triple single quotes)
a = "Pawan"
print(a)

# int data type (Can +ve or -ve)
b = 45
print(b)

# float data type
c = 89.45
print(c)

# boolean data type
d= True
print(d)

# none data type. It basically defines us "nothing"
e = None
print(e)


# you can name your variable anything beside the reserved keywords or keywords
# these keywords are part of core Python are used in build purpose. Hence not recommended to use as variable
# e.g. "def", "import", True etc.


# To detect type of variable we use type()
print(type(e))
